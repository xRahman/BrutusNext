1. Update typescript in our /node_modules directory
   (this one is actually used both for compiling the
    code and for compiling the ingame scripts).

  npm install typescript --save

2. Update typescript globally
   (This is not really necessary but it prevents vs code
    from bitching about mismatched versions ;))

  npm install -g typescript
