Triggers
----------

Trigger handlers are functions that are run in specific situations.
For example 'onLoad()' is run when an entity is instantiated.

Automatic super() call
-----------------------

Don't call super.trigger() inside a trigger handler.

Triggers are run by Entity.runTriggerHandler() method which traverses
prototype tree and runs respective trigger handler on all prototype
objects that have it. This eliminate the need to type suppper.trigger()
in every trigger handler (which would definitely be ommited by mistake
often which would lead to errors).

Triggers on entity shared data
-------------------------------------

Trigger handlers are also automatically run on entity shared data
(the same way as on entity so again don't call super.trigger()).
