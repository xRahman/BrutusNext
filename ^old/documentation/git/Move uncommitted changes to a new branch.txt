How to move uncommited changes to a new branch and reset 'master' branch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Get into the master branch.
git checkout master

# Create a new branch for the changes and check it out.
git checkout -b dev_branch

# Stash the changes until we revert master.
git stash

# Go back to master.
git checkout master

# Reset to the last commit.
git reset --hard HEAD

# Go back to dev_branch.
git checkout dev_branch

# Re-apply the stashed changes and you are good to go.
git stash apply


# Optional: Set remote origin to a new branch
#  (so a 'git pull' and 'git push' will work on the new branch).
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/dev_branch dev_branch
