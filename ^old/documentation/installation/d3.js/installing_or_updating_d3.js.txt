Install d3:

  npm install d3 --save

Install typescript type definitions:

  npm install @types/d3 --save-dev

/*
Then you can import d3 as follows:

  import * as d3 from 'd3';

// Yes, you can, but we are not using it,
// because browsers don't know ES6 modules
// yet. So we have to do it require.js way.

// (We still need type definitions though).
*/

Copy file node_modules/d3/build/d3.min.js
to client/js/d3/d3.min.js

- this is the only part of d3 library we
  actually use. It's referenced using

  import d3 = require('d3');

  (You also need to add an alias to 'paths'
   in 'requirejs.config' in /client/js/Main.js)


/*
// Alternative way to get d3.min.js:
// (not used)

Download from:
https://d3js.org/

And copy file d3.min.js to /client/js/d3
