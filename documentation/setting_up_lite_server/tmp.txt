'lite-server' is used for client development. You can also use any other webserver
you like, just set /BrutusNext/client as a root folder for web documents.


Right now I'm installing it globally: 

  npm install -g lite-server

Then just run lite-server in BrutusNext/client, or run the batch file:

  BrutusNext/client/run_development_webserver.bat
