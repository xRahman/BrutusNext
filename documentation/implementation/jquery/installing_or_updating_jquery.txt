Install or update jquery using:

  npm install jquery

Then go to /BrutusNext/node_modules/jquery/dist and copy appropriate
file to /BrutusNext/client/jquery.

/*
  Right now I'm using jquery.slim.js.

  It would be nice to automate copying based on debug/release build
  configuration, but it has low priority at the moment.
