Scrolling textarea html element
--------------------------------

Browser automatically scrolls textarea to the end when it gets focus.
So you can scroll it to the end by doing:
  $textarea.blur().focus();

To scroll it to a ceratain position in text (for example to a cerain line),
you can set a partial text to it (ending with your last line), do the focus
trick and set the whole text back.
