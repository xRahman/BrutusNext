Logging

Game Logic Errors
------------------

Example: 

Use ERROR();

This will also log stack trace where the log occured.


Program Errors
---------------

Example: Variable is 'null' when not supposed to be.

Handling: Throw an Error object with a message describing the eror:

{
  if (element === null)
    throw new Error("'element' is not supposed to be 'null'");
}

Catching of exception:

try
{
  something();
}
catch (error)
{
  REPORT(error, "Something is not going to happen");
}
