There is a central (bare) repository for the BrutusNext project, initially
located at /home/rahman/repository/BrutusNext.git

To clone a working copy of it use (it will create a BrutusNext subdirectory):

git clone /home/rahman/repository/BrutusNext.git


To access the central repository from the outside (via ssh) use:
rahman@brutus/home/rahman/repository/BrutusNext.git
