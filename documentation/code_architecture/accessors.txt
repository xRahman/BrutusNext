Use getSomething() and setSomething() methods instead of accessors.

Reason: If you wanted a public accessor for a private class variable, you would
have to create a different name the actual variable. Having variable x accessed
by function getX() is more intuitive.


When to use accessors:
- for constants, for example:
    protected get SAVE_DIRECTORY() { return "./data/realms/"; }

- for static acces, for example
    public static get entities() { return Server.game.entities; }
  (in this case class variable 'entities' can exist along with an accessor
  of the same name, because accessor is static)
