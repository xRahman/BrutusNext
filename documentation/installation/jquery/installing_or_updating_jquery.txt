Install or update jquery using:

  npm install jquery

Type definitions:

  npm install @types/jquery --save-dev

Then go to node_modules/jquery/dist and copy file
jquery.min.js to client/js/jquery/jquery.min.js.

/*
  Right now we are using jquery.slim.js.

  It would be nice to automate copying based on debug/release
  build configuration, but it has low priority at the moment.
