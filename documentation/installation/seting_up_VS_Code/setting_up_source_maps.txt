Intented project structure:
- source files are located in /src
- generated javascript files (and respective souce maps) are located in
  /build/client/js or /build/server/js

What must be set:
-----------------

1) In /src/server/tsconfig.json:

// Note: Directory path are relative to the location of tsconfig.json file.

  "outDir": "../../build/server/js",
  "rootDir": "../",
  "sourceRoot": "../"

  "sourceMap": true,
  // This is very important - it makes the compiler to add "sourceRoot"
  // parameter to generated .map files so the path to original typescript
  // file can be constructed.
  // (Parameters "sourceRoot" plus "sources" must combine to give the correct
  // path.)

2) in /.vscode/launch.json:

  "sourceMaps": true,
  // The '/build/' part is important here.
  "outFiles": [ "${workspaceRoot}/build/server/js/**/*.js" ]

Note that source maps contain absolute paths - it means that they are only
valid on the machine where they were generated.


3) In /src/client/tsconfig.json:

// Note: Directory path are relative to the location of tsconfig.json file.

  "outDir": "../../build/client/js",
  "rootDir": "../",
  "sourceRoot": "../"

  "sourceMap": true,
  // This is very important - it makes the compiler to add "sourceRoot"
  // parameter to generated .map files so the path to original typescript
  // file can be constructed.
  // (Parameters "sourceRoot" plus "sources" must combine to give the correct
  // path.)
