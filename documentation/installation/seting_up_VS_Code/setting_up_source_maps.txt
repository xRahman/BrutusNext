Intented project structure:
- source files are located in /src
- generated javascript files (and respective souce maps) are located in /build

What must be set:
-----------------

1) In tsconfig.json:

  "outDir": "build",

  "rootDir": "src",

  "sourceMap": true,
  // This is very important - it makes the compiler to add "sourceRoot" parameter
  // to generated .map files so the path to original typescript file can be constructed.
  // (parameters "sourceRoot" plus "sources" must together give the correct path)
  "sourceRoot": "src"

2) in /.vscode/launch.json:

  "sourceMaps": true,
  // The '/build/' part is important here.
  "outFiles": [ "${workspaceRoot}/build/**/*.js" ]

Note that source maps contain absolute paths - it means that they are only valid on
the machine where they were generated.
