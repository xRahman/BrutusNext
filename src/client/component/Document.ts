      Notes on shortcuts:
    
      'Ctrl + C' or 'Ctrl + Ins' -- copies the text into the clipboard.
        We don't want to give focus to the input element on these combinations,
        because focusing input would prevent copying the selected text.

      'Ctrl + X' or 'Shift + Del' cuts the text into the clipboard.
        We don't want to give focus to the input element on these combinations,
        because  the selection or cursor isn't actully in the input element
        so user doesn't expect the text to be deleted from the input element.
          Selected text actually won't be deleted from the output element
        (because it's disabled), but that's intended and intuitive behaviour.

      'Ctrl + V' or 'Shift + Ins' inserts the text from the clipboard.
        We do want to give focus to the input element, because it's the only
        element where it makes sense to put the text. It also saves the
        user one operation (clicking to input with the mouse to give it
        focus) when she wants to copy something from the output to the
        input. She only needs to select the text and pres 'Ctrl + C'
        followed by 'Ctrl + V' (or 'Ctrl + Ins' followed by 'Shift + Ins'). 

      'Del' deletes the selected text or the character at cursor position.
      'Backspace' deletes selected text or the character before cursor.
        We do not give focus to the input element, because user can't see
        the cursor so it would delete a seemingly random character from
        the input text. It won't do anything because deleting is disabled
        in output element.

      'Ctrl + Z' -- undo
      'Ctrl + Y' -- redo
        We give focus to the input elemet, because it's the only place where
        undoing or redoing makes sense.

      'Ctrl + A' -- select all
        We don't focus the input element, because user wants to select
        all text wherever she currecly is.

      'Tab' -- cycle to the next field
      'Shift + Tab' -- cycle to previous field
        We don't focus the input element, because 'Tab' is supposed to cycle
        between field which would be prevented by focusing the input (and
        tabbing doesn't work in the input element anyways).

      'Home' -- to beginning of line or far left of field or screen.
      'End' -- to end of line, or far right of field or screen.
        We give focus to the input elemet, because this doesn't make
        sense in the output.

      'Ctrl + Home' -- to the top
      'Ctrl + End' -- to the bottom
        We don't focus the input element, because user may want to
        scroll the output all the way up or down.

      'PageUp' -- moves you up by one page
      'PageDown' -- moves you down by one page
        These keys are always redirected to the output element so the user
        can scroll the output up or down even when typing commands to the
        input (or doing anything else). Paging the input element doesn't
        makes sense, because it works as a command buffer where cursor keys
        (Up or Down) recall previous or next command.

      Cursor keys ('Left', 'Right', 'Up', 'Down')
        We give focus to the input elemet, because cursor keys don't make
        any sense in the output.
        /// TODO: Asi je ale budu pot≈ôebovat v mapperu.

      'Shift + Ctrl + Right' -- select the whole word
        We give focus to the input elemet, because there is not
        cursor in the output element so it wouldn't do anything.

      'Esc'
        We don't focus the input element, because whatever escape
        does (if anything), it should do it where the focus is.
