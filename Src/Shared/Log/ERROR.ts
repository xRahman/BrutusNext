/*
  Runtime error reporting

  --------------------------------------------------------
          EVERY ERROR() NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP!
        (Even if the MUD doesn't crash right away)
  --------------------------------------------------------

  Usage example:

    import {ERROR} from 'Shared/Log/ERROR';

    if (damage > MAX_DAMAGE)
    {
      ERROR(`Damage '${damage}' exceeds allowed maximum of '${MAX_DAMAGE}'`);
      damage = MAX_DAMAGE;
    }

  Notes:
    If you need to return from the function after reporting an error,
    throw an exception instead. ERROR() should only be used if you want
    to log something that you can immediately recover from.

    Try to write error messages that explain what are the possible causes
    and available solutions. At the time of writing of ERROR(), you probably
    know quite well what could go wrong. 5 years later you will pay gold for
    any such hint.

    Don't include name of the function where error occured. Stack trace is
    added automatically to the log message.

import { SyslogUtils } from "../../Shared/Log/SyslogUtils";

export function ERROR(message: string)
{
  SyslogUtils.reportError(message);
}
